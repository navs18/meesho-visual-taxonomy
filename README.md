Predict attributes from product image
Visual Taxonomy: Predict attribute values of products

Overview
Have you ever encountered a product listing on an e-commerce platform where the image showed a short - sleeve shirt, but the description claimed it was long-sleeved? Such discrepancies are not just frustrating for customers, they're a significant challenge for e-commerce platforms striving to maintain accurate product catalogs at scale.

Problem Statement
The competition challenges to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict various product attributes (such as color, pattern, and sleeve length) solely from product images.

Solution
Our solution focuses on accurately predicting various product attributes (such as color, pattern, and sleeve length) using a machine learning model trained on product images. Here’s an overview of the approach:

Data Preparation:
The dataset consists of product images and corresponding labels for different attributes.
We performed data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and normalizing the images.
The images were augmented to increase the diversity of the training data and improve model generalization.
Model Architecture:
We utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, such as EfficientNet or ResNet, for feature extraction from images.
The final layers of the network were customized for multi-label classification to predict multiple attributes simultaneously.
Training Strategy:
The model was trained using a combination of cross-entropy loss and other relevant metrics to optimize the attribute predictions.
We employed techniques like multiple learning rate, dropout, batch normalisation and data shuffling to enhance the training process.
Evaluation and Testing:
The model’s performance was evaluated using metrics like F1-score and accuracy.
We used test set to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
The best setting, which provide maximum F1-score till now is considered as default in our code.
Post-Processing:
The model's outputs were refined using thresholding techniques to adjust predictions for each attribute.
Additional checks were implemented to ensure consistency between predicted attributes.
Step 1
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 2
Download the dataset from here Make sure that the dataset is in dataset folder having train.csv, test.csv, category_attributes.parquet, train_images, and test_images.

Step 3
cd ../src
Step 4
python main.py
The above code only run in default setting (best for 16GB GPU) though the further attributes (hyperparameters and model) can be passed, including learning rate as --lr, maixmum pixel size --pixel, batch size --batch_size, model name --model_name, and path where model get saved as --save_path, as per requirements. For example

For running on EfficientNet by fine tuning it:
python main.py --lr 0.0001 --batch_size 32 --pixel 640 --model_name DeepMultiOutputModel_EfficientNet --save_path model
For running on RegNet by fine tuning it:
python main.py --lr 0.0001 --batch_size 32 --pixel 640 --model_name DeepMultiOutputModel_RegNet --save_path model
For running on our custom build model:
python main.py --lr 0.0001 --batch_size 1024 --pixel 640 --model_name DeepMultiOutputModel --save_path model
For our custom build model, we recommend using batch_size more than 512 to get better stability while training.

Conclusion
Developed and optimized multi-output CNN models (including custom CNN, RegNet-16GF, and EfficientNet) to predict 10 different product attributes (e.g., color, pattern, sleeve length) from e-commerce product images, achieving an average F1 score of 0.6487.
